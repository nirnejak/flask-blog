<h1>Blog Application</h1>
<h3>Flask Based Web Application for Blogging</h3>
<hr>
This is a web application for blogging. It uses lightweight Micro-framework Flask with Python for web development.

In this application users can read, write, edit and delete articles. They can register with their, Name, username and email. After they are registed they can write, edit or delete posts. Without loggin in the users can only read the articles.

The application uses MySQL database in it's backend. All the queries are written for it.

In the future I am planning to add REST API suppport.
